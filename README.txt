# CS+SG Fall 2023 Education Team: Homework 1

## Introduction

In this homework assignment, you will be applying what you've learned by creating your very own website portfolio. This is not only a great way to practice your skills but also a fantastic starting point to showcase your work in the future.

## Requirements

1. **HTML & CSS**: Your portfolio should be written in HTML and should utilize CSS for styling. This includes:

   - Utilizing header tags, paragraph tags, divs, lists, etc.
   - Creating appealing visual designs with elements like borders, backgrounds, etc.
   - I stress that you try to make this as visually appealing as possible!
   - [W3Schools CSS Reference Guide](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/index.php)
   - [For an in-depth guide into HTML and CSS!](https://internetingishard.netlify.app/)

2. **Flexbox**: Your design must include at least one flexbox component. This is a great opportunity to make your layout responsive and clean!

### Bonus

**JavaScript**: Incorporate JavaScript into your portfolio. For example, you can use:

   - The alert box we discussed in class.
   - Any other JavaScript functions that you find appealing by looking around on Google!

*This is optional since we didn't fully have a chance to merge our JavaScript file with our HTML in class!!*

## Resources

Please remember that while you're working on this assignment, you can always refer to:

- Lecture notes
- Personal notes
- Teaching Assistants (TAs)

## Submission

Once you've completed your portfolio, make sure to review the requirements and ensure you've met them all. Then, submit your assignment as per the guidelines provided in class.

## Download New Course Material

“Pulling” course materials down from Upstream. As new lesson material or starter code for exercises and projects is added to our central course repository, these are the steps you’ll take to download them into your own workspace repository.

1. Open the _View_ menu and select _Command Palette_
   - The shortcut for this menu is:
   - Windows: `Control+Shift+P`
   - Mac: `Command+Shift+P`
2. Begin typing in `Git: Pull From...` and press `Enter` once it is the first option.
3. Begin typing in `origin` and press `Enter` once it is the first option.
4. Press enter with `origin/master` as the first option.
5. This downloads the latest course materials! It will succeed silently, so if nothing appears to happen it worked (and any new files will be available in the file explorer). If there was an error, you would see an error message pop up.

## Backup Your Work

“Push” your work up to GitHub for backup. By creating “commits”, which you can think of as versioned checkpoints in your workspace, you are not at risk of losing your work. It’s easy to revert back to an old version or to restore your entire workspace on a different computer.

1. Select the _View_ menu and then _SCM_ (Source Control Management)
   - Alternatively: Select the Activity Bar icon that’s three circles with lines for Source Control
2. Notice the files listed under Changes. These are files you’ve made modifications to since your last backup.
3. Move your mouse’s cursor over the word changes and notice the + symbol that appears. Click that plus symbol to add all changes to the next backup. You will now see these listed under “Staged Changes”.
   - If you do not want to backup _all_ changed files, you can select them individually. For this course you’re encouraged to back everything up.
4. In the Message box, give a brief description of what you’ve changed and are backing up. This will help you find a specific backup (called a “commit”) if needed.
5. Open the _View_ menu and select _Command Palette_, the shortcut for this menu is:
   - Windows: `Control+Shift+P`
   - Mac: `Command+Shift+P`
6. Begin typing in: `Git: Push to...` and press `Enter` once it is the first option.
7. Select the `backup` remote that is your personal workspace on GitHub. If you do not see `backup` listed, see the instructions below on _Setup Backup Course Material Repository_.
   - You may see a spinning “refresh” icon in your status bar at the bottom of VSCode. Unless an error backing up occurs, you will not see any confirmation.
   - If you want to see your backed up work on Github, navigate to the following URL but replace `USERNAME` with your GitHub username:
   - `https://github.com/cssgunc/homework-1-USERNAME`
